## 🔧 **Ready-to-Use Examples**

### Quick Start (when piper-tts is available)
```python
from whisper_streaming.tts import synthesize_turkish, TTSEngine

# Direct Piper usage
audio_path = synthesize_turkish(
    text="Merhaba! Bu Piper TTS entegrasyonu.",
    engine=TTSEngine.PIPER_TTS
)
```

### Auto-Selection (works now)
```python
# Automatically chooses best available engine
audio_path = synthesize_turkish(
    text="Otomatik motor seçimi",
    engine=TTSEngine.AUTO  # Will use Coqui TTS currently
)
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
from whisper_streaming.tts import TTSConfig, PiperTTS

config = TTSConfig(
    language="tr",
    piper_model="dfki-medium",
    speed=1.1,
    use_turkish_phonetics=True
)

# Will work when piper-tts is installed
tts = PiperTTS(config)
```

---

## 🚀 **Installation & Deployment**

### When Platform Support is Available
```bash
# Primary installation method
pip install piper-tts

# Or with project dependencies
pip install -r requirements/library/requirements.txt
```

### Current Limitation
- **macOS ARM64**: piper-phonemize wheels not available
- **Linux/Windows**: Should work with standard pip installation
- **Alternative**: Binary distribution available from GitHub releases

### Docker/Production Ready
The integration supports:
- Custom model directories for containers
- Offline operation after initial setup
- Configurable download paths for CI/CD

---
