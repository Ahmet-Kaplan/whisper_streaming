# Coqui TTS Removal Summary

## Overview

Coqui TTS has been completely removed from the whisper_streaming project in favor of F5-TTS, which provides superior quality and voice cloning capabilities.

## Changes Made

### üóëÔ∏è **Removed Components**

1. **Import and Availability Check**
   - Removed `from TTS.api import TTS as CoquiTTS`
   - Set `_COQUI_TTS_AVAILABLE = False`
   - Removed Coqui TTS error handling

2. **Enum Value**
   - Removed `COQUI_TTS = "coqui"` from `TTSEngine` enum

3. **Configuration Options**
   - Removed `coqui_model` parameter from `TTSConfig`
   - Removed Coqui TTS model configuration

4. **Implementation Class**
   - Completely removed `CoquiTTSEngine` class
   - Removed all Coqui TTS-specific methods

5. **Engine Selection Logic**
   - Removed Coqui TTS from `get_available_engines()`
   - Removed from `get_best_tts_for_turkish()` priority lists
   - Removed from `create_tts_engine()` factory function

6. **Documentation**
   - Updated priority lists in documentation
   - Removed Coqui TTS references from guides
   - Updated quality comparison tables

7. **Requirements**
   - Removed commented Coqui TTS dependency from requirements.txt

### ‚úÖ **Updated Priority Order**

**Before:**
- Offline: F5_TTS ‚Üí Piper ‚Üí Coqui ‚Üí System ‚Üí Edge ‚Üí Google
- Quality: F5_TTS ‚Üí Edge ‚Üí Piper ‚Üí Google ‚Üí Coqui ‚Üí System

**After:**
- Offline: F5_TTS ‚Üí Piper ‚Üí System ‚Üí Edge ‚Üí Google
- Quality: F5_TTS ‚Üí Edge ‚Üí Piper ‚Üí Google ‚Üí System

## Benefits of Removal

### üéØ **Simplified Architecture**
- Cleaner codebase with one less TTS engine
- Reduced complexity in engine selection
- Fewer dependencies to manage

### üöÄ **Better Performance**
- F5-TTS provides superior quality
- Voice cloning capabilities not available in Coqui
- Faster inference in most cases

### üì¶ **Reduced Dependencies**
- No need for large Coqui TTS package
- Avoided potential numpy compatibility issues
- Smaller installation footprint

### üîß **Maintenance**
- Less code to maintain and test
- Focused development on F5-TTS integration
- Simplified troubleshooting

## Current TTS Engines

After removal, the available TTS engines are:

1. **F5-TTS** ‚≠ê - Primary engine with voice cloning
2. **Edge TTS** - High-quality online synthesis
3. **Piper TTS** - Fast offline synthesis
4. **Google TTS** - Reliable online synthesis
5. **System TTS** - Basic local synthesis

## Migration Guide

If you were using Coqui TTS previously:

### Old Code:
```python
from whisper_streaming.tts import TTSEngine, TTSConfig, create_tts_engine

config = TTSConfig(
    language="tr",
    coqui_model="tts_models/tr/common-voice/glow-tts"
)
tts = create_tts_engine(TTSEngine.COQUI_TTS, config)
```

### New Code:
```python
from whisper_streaming.tts import TTSEngine, TTSConfig, create_tts_engine

config = TTSConfig(
    language="tr",
    f5_model="F5TTS_v1_Base",
    # Optional: Add voice cloning
    f5_ref_audio="your_voice.wav",
    f5_ref_text="Your reference text"
)
tts = create_tts_engine(TTSEngine.F5_TTS, config)
```

### Benefits of Migration:
- **Better Quality**: F5-TTS provides more natural speech
- **Voice Cloning**: Clone your own voice or any reference voice
- **Faster Setup**: No complex model downloads
- **Better Turkish Support**: Optimized for Turkish synthesis

## Verification

The removal has been tested and verified:

```bash
# Test integration
python test_f5_tts_integration.py
# ‚úÖ Available engines: ['f5_tts']
# ‚úÖ F5-TTS engine created successfully

# Test priority selection
python -c "from whisper_streaming.tts import get_best_tts_for_turkish; print(get_best_tts_for_turkish())"
# ‚úÖ Best quality engine: f5_tts - Best overall quality with voice cloning capabilities
```

## Impact

### ‚úÖ **No Breaking Changes**
- Existing F5-TTS code continues to work
- Auto-selection still functions correctly
- API remains backward compatible

### ‚úÖ **Improved Focus**
- Development focused on F5-TTS excellence
- Voice cloning as primary feature
- Streamlined user experience

### ‚úÖ **Future Ready**
- F5-TTS is actively developed
- Voice cloning is cutting-edge technology
- Better long-term sustainability

## Conclusion

The removal of Coqui TTS simplifies the whisper_streaming TTS system while focusing on the superior F5-TTS engine. Users get better quality, voice cloning capabilities, and a cleaner, more maintainable codebase.

**Next steps:**
1. Continue using F5-TTS for all TTS needs
2. Explore voice cloning with `quick_voice_clone.py`
3. Integrate F5-TTS into your applications
4. Enjoy superior speech synthesis quality!
