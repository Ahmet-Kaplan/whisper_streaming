# Coqui TTS Addition Summary

## Overview

Coqui TTS has been successfully added back to the whisper_streaming project using the maintained `coqui-tts` package. This provides users with an additional high-quality open-source TTS option while keeping F5-TTS as the top priority engine.

## Changes Made

### ‚úÖ **Added Components**

1. **Package Installation**
   - Added `coqui-tts` to `requirements/library/requirements.txt`
   - Successfully installed maintained Coqui TTS fork (v0.26.2)
   - Uses proper import: `from TTS.api import TTS as CoquiTTS`

2. **Engine Integration**
   - Added `COQUI_TTS = "coqui"` to `TTSEngine` enum
   - Restored `CoquiTTSEngine` class with updated imports
   - Added back `coqui_model` configuration parameter

3. **Implementation Class**
   - `CoquiTTSEngine` class implementing `BaseTTS` interface
   - Turkish model support with `tts_models/tr/common-voice/glow-tts`
   - Proper error handling and logging

4. **Engine Selection Logic**
   - Added Coqui TTS to `get_available_engines()`
   - Integrated into `get_best_tts_for_turkish()` priority lists
   - Added to `create_tts_engine()` factory function

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Updated priority lists in documentation
   - Added Coqui TTS to quality comparison tables
   - Maintained F5-TTS as highest priority

### üéØ **Updated Priority Order**

**New Priority (with Coqui TTS):**
- **Offline Priority**: F5-TTS ‚Üí Piper ‚Üí **Coqui** ‚Üí System ‚Üí Edge ‚Üí Google
- **Quality Priority**: F5-TTS ‚Üí Edge ‚Üí Piper ‚Üí **Coqui** ‚Üí Google ‚Üí System

F5-TTS remains the top priority, with Coqui TTS as a solid alternative.

## Current TTS Engine Lineup

After addition, the complete TTS engine lineup is:

1. **F5-TTS** ‚≠ê - State-of-the-art with voice cloning (highest priority)
2. **Edge TTS** - High-quality online synthesis
3. **Piper TTS** - Fast and lightweight offline
4. **Coqui TTS** üÜï - Good quality open-source alternative
5. **Google TTS** - Reliable online synthesis
6. **System TTS** - Basic local synthesis

## Testing Results

```bash
‚úÖ Available engines: ['coqui', 'f5_tts']
‚úÖ Coqui TTS is available and detected
‚úÖ Engine Priority:
   Offline preference: f5_tts - State-of-the-art offline quality with voice cloning
   Quality preference: f5_tts - Best overall quality with voice cloning capabilities
```

## Usage Examples

### Auto-Selection (Will Prefer F5-TTS)
```python
from whisper_streaming.tts import synthesize_turkish, TTSEngine

# Auto-selects best available (F5-TTS if available, otherwise Coqui)
audio = synthesize_turkish("Turkish text here", engine=TTSEngine.AUTO)
```

### Explicit Coqui TTS Usage
```python
from whisper_streaming.tts import TTSEngine, TTSConfig, create_tts_engine

config = TTSConfig(language="tr", coqui_model="tts_models/tr/common-voice/glow-tts")
tts = create_tts_engine(TTSEngine.COQUI_TTS, config)
result = tts.synthesize("Coqui TTS ile konu≈üma sentezi")
```

### Comparing Engines
```python
# F5-TTS with voice cloning
f5_config = TTSConfig(
    language="tr",
    f5_model="F5TTS_v1_Base",
    f5_ref_audio="your_voice.wav",
    f5_ref_text="Reference text"
)

# Coqui TTS with Turkish model
coqui_config = TTSConfig(
    language="tr", 
    coqui_model="tts_models/tr/common-voice/glow-tts"
)
```

## Migration from Original TTS

If you were using the original TTS package:

### Old (Original TTS):
```python
from TTS.api import TTS
tts = TTS(model_name="tts_models/tr/common-voice/glow-tts")
```

### New (Integrated Coqui TTS):
```python
from whisper_streaming.tts import TTSEngine, TTSConfig, create_tts_engine

config = TTSConfig(coqui_model="tts_models/tr/common-voice/glow-tts")
tts = create_tts_engine(TTSEngine.COQUI_TTS, config)
```

## Quality Comparison

| Method | Quality | Speed | Ease of Use | Turkish Support |
|--------|---------|-------|-------------|-----------------|
| F5-TTS | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Edge TTS | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Coqui TTS | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |
| Piper TTS | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê | ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê |

## Impact

### ‚úÖ **No Breaking Changes**
- Existing F5-TTS code continues to work
- F5-TTS remains highest priority
- Auto-selection still prefers F5-TTS

### ‚úÖ **Enhanced Capabilities**
- More choice for users
- Better fallback options
- Improved Turkish TTS coverage

### ‚úÖ **Maintained Quality**
- F5-TTS still primary recommendation
- Coqui TTS as solid alternative
- All engines work harmoniously

## Conclusion

The addition of Coqui TTS provides users with more choice while maintaining F5-TTS as the premier engine. The integration is seamless, with F5-TTS continuing to be the top priority for both offline and quality preferences.

**Current Status:**
- ‚úÖ F5-TTS: Primary engine with voice cloning
- ‚úÖ Coqui TTS: Quality open-source alternative  
- ‚úÖ Full engine integration complete
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive Turkish language support

Users now have access to both state-of-the-art F5-TTS voice cloning and reliable Coqui TTS synthesis, providing the best of both worlds!
